# Heart_Disease_Classification
Data science project aiming to classify a patient if he/she has a heart disease or not

In the V1 version of the Jupyter Notebook, NestedCV approach is used to see the generalization performance of the models. Results are shown as mean of the folds at the end.

In V2, same NestedCV approach is used. Difference is that; it shows the results and best selected hyperparameters for each fold. It can allow you to analyze generalization performance for different folds, if there is a critical variation through hyperparameters for example, you may need to re-evaluate the base model and preprocessing steps.
